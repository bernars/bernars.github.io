<p>Heartbleed is blah blah blah how it affects you in non-techy terms. Maybe mention OpenSSL ONCE and never mention it again.</p>

<p>For very technical information about the vulnerability, see <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">this excellent information</a> from <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile">Filippo Valsorda</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, companies with your private information are working hard to update their servers to keep your information safe. A great number of them have already done so!</p>

<p>As soon as each company patches their vulnerability, they may do one of two things - force you to create a new password (good!) or leave you to update your password on your own (not great, but you're strong, you can do this!).</p>

<h3>
<a name="automatically-update-your-credentials" class="anchor" href="#automatically-update-your-credentials"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatically update your credentials</h3>

<p>Some sites and services may force you to create a new password the next time you sign in.</p>

<p>Bonus: LastPass and 1Password can save that password for you so you don't need to remember it!</p>

<h3>
<a name="leave-you-to-update-your-credentials-yourself" class="anchor" href="#leave-you-to-update-your-credentials-yourself"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Leave you to update your credentials yourself</h3>

<p>Some services are going to just patch the vulnerability and be done with it. In those cases, it's up to you to update your password yourself. The key is to change your password <em>after</em> the vulnerability has been patched.</p>

<h2>
<a name="what-you-should-do-right-now" class="anchor" href="#what-you-should-do-right-now"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What you should do right now</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a list of the sites you most often use a password to access. Think about sites you use for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Banking</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Buying books and music</li>
</ul>
<p>To get an idea of the sites you use most often, check your web history.</p>
</li>
<li>Check to see if theyâ€™ve been patched <a href="http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/">using the Heartbleed Test</a>.</li>
<li>Generate a new, secure password for each site. To create a password, consider using a password generator, such as those available from <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> or <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>.</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="what-you-should-do-going-forward" class="anchor" href="#what-you-should-do-going-forward"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What you should do going forward</h3>

<h3>
<a name="use-a-super-strong-password" class="anchor" href="#use-a-super-strong-password"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use a super strong password</h3>

<h3>
<a name="dont-use-the-same-password-more-than-once" class="anchor" href="#dont-use-the-same-password-more-than-once"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't use the same password more than once</h3>

<p>This means that your Facebook password should be <em>completely</em> different from your password on any other site. Don't use any tricks you think are clever, like using the same base password and altering each password a little bit at the beginning or end. Such passwords can be guessed!</p>

<h3>
<a name="dont-share-your-password-with-anyone-intentionally-or-unintentionally" class="anchor" href="#dont-share-your-password-with-anyone-intentionally-or-unintentionally"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't share your password with anyone, intentionally or unintentionally</h3>

<p>It's hard to remember your passwords. The strongest passwords are really long and contain lots of different characters, cases, and numbers, which makes it nearly impossible to remember all of them.</p>
