            <p>Heartbleed is a security vulnerability discovered in a common encryption technology called OpenSSL on April 7, 2014. It can allow <em>anyone</em> to fairly easily get your information, often pretty useless, but sometimes including information that can be used to figure out your password.</p>

            <p>For anyone interested, you can find <em>very technical information</em> about the vulnerability at <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">heartbleed.com</a> from <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile">Filippo Valsorda</a>.</p>

          <h2>

              <p>Right now, companies with your private information are working hard to update their servers to keep your information safe. A great number of them have already done so!</p>

              <p>As soon as each company patches their vulnerability, they may do one of two things - force you to create a new password (good!) or leave you to update your password on your own (not great, but you're strong, you can do this!).</p>

            <h3>
              <a name="automatically-update-your-credentials" class="anchor" href="#automatically-update-your-credentials"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatically update your credentials</h3>

                <p>Some sites and services may force you to create a new password the next time you sign in. It may seem frustrating, but it's a really kind and thoughtful thing they're doing for you!</p>

            <h3>
              <a name="leave-you-to-update-your-credentials-yourself" class="anchor" href="#leave-you-to-update-your-credentials-yourself"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Leave you to update your credentials yourself</h3>

                <p>Some services are going to just patch the vulnerability and be done with it. In those cases, it's up to you to update your password yourself. The key is to change your password <em>after</em> the vulnerability has been patched.</p>

            <a name="what-you-should-do-right-now" class="anchor" href="#what-you-should-do-right-now"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What you should do right now</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Make a list of the sites you most often use a password to access. To get an idea of the sites you use most often, check your web history. Think about sites you use for:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Banking</li>
                      <li>Email</li>
                      <li>Buying books and music</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>You'll especially want to check sites you accessed between April 7th and 8th, 2014, though basically every site you access with a password should be checked, regardless of when you accessed it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Check to see if theyâ€™ve been patched <a href="http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/">using the Heartbleed Test</a>. Just type the website in the field provided. For example, <a href="http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/#yahoo.com">Yahoo.com has been fixed.</li>
                <li><a href="#use-a-super-strong-password">Generate a new, strong, secure password</a> for each site. To create a password, consider using a password generator, such as those available from <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> or <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>. You can also use those sites </li>
              </ol>

                <p>These are tips for keeping yourself safe not only in the wake of Heartbleed, but for any future security incidents or random criminal attempts to access your information.

              <h3>
                <a name="use-a-super-strong-password" class="anchor" href="#use-a-super-strong-password"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use a super strong password</h3>
                  <p>A strong password is:</p>

                    <li>Long! I mean, like, 16 characters or more, in an ideal world!</li>
                    <li>A combination of letters (both upper- and lower-case), numbers, special characters</li>

                  <p>If the website you're using doesn't support the things above, you should consider not using it.</p>

              <h3>
                <a name="dont-use-the-same-password-more-than-once" class="anchor" href="#dont-use-the-same-password-more-than-once"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't use the same password more than once</h3>

                  <p>This means that your Facebook password should be <em>completely</em> different from your password on any other site. Don't use any tricks you think are clever, like using the same base password and altering each password a little bit at the beginning or end. Such passwords can be guessed!</p>

              <h3>
                <a name="dont-share-your-password-with-anyone-intentionally-or-unintentionally" class="anchor" href="#dont-share-your-password-with-anyone-intentionally-or-unintentionally"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't share your password with anyone, intentionally or unintentionally</h3>

                  <p>It's hard to remember your passwords. As we've already covered above, the best passwords are unique, really long, and contain lots of different characters, cases, and numbers, which makes it nearly impossible to remember all of them.</p>

                  <p>You might be tempted to write your most important passwords down on a piece of paper and put them in your wallet, or put them on a sticky note attached to your work monitor. This is just as good as telling someone your password. This is even worse if you use the same password for multiple sites - figuring out which other sites give a bad guy access using that password is so much easier than you think!</p>

                  <p>For these reasons, it's best to use a password manager such as LastPass or 1Password.

                <a name="enable-a-second-layer-of-authentication" class="anchor" href="#enable-a-second-layer-of-authentication"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Enable a second layer of authentication</h3>

                  <p>What if I told you there was a way to add a <em>second layer of security</em> to your accounts? Say someone is successfully able to figure out your password. If you have two step verification enabled, the nefarious individual with your password won't be able to access your information because they'll be asked to provide a code that only you have access to!</p>

                  <p>A lot of sites you might use pretty often support two step verification. Here are some of them, along with links to their instructions on enabling it:</p>

                    </ul>
                  <p>Some financial institutions provide an additional level of security as well, though in some cases it's not quite equivalent to two-factor authentication. Anything helps, though!</p>

                   <p>The fantastic website <a href="http://twofactorauth.org/">twofactorauth.org includes an incredibly thorough list of sites, orgnized by categories such as Social, Retail, Financial, etc. It's a good way to quickly see if some of the sites you use and love support two step verification, and if they don't, it even provides a handy button to ask the company to support it, already!</p>
